# Statistical-and-Machine-Learning-Approaches-for-Portfolio-Optimization
Six portfolio optimization strategies were considered, plus one benchmark. We considered methods relying both in ML and common statistical procedures; and we run an out-of-sample back-test for each strategy. Through performance metric calculations, we determine that ML methods significantly improve returns, but not always increase the Sharpe Ratio.
